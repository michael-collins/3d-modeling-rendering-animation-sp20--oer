## Course Objectives
**Upon completing the course each student will have:**

* Learned the basics of 3D Animation, Modeling, and production and post-production.
* Completed technical/conceptual projects (assignments) as set out by the instructor, accompanied by an artist statement.
* Assessed projects in relation to the stated objectives of the assignment.
* Developed a language suitable for descriptive and critical understandings of their assignments and broader themes related to new media art.
* Participated actively in all group-discussions.

### Course Requirements
Each class will meet in 401 Paterson. Attendance is mandatory; as this time will be used for critiques, reading discussions, presentations, video screenings, collaborative or group work, and the dissemination of general information. These sessions will at all times emphasize critical analysis and in­class discussion. In terms of studio production, whole class meetings may review work­in­progress; assess ongoing technical concerns; assist with immediate needs of a project concept and execution all the while continuing to develop a language appropriate for evaluation and critique. While there will be a limited amount of in­class time to experiment and complete work, you will be required to spend many hours working outside of class­ time.

### Course Prerequisites
ART 201, ART 211, and enrollment in the ART BA, ART BFA, Art Education, or Integrative Arts degree program or IDS program.

### Attendance Policy
LATE EXERCISES AND PROJECTS WILL NOT BE GRADED. Attendance is mandatory and professionalism both in and outside of class is a MUST. You are expected to participate in class discussions and critiques. Respect for others and class materials (cameras, decks etc) is expected. Students will be allowed three (3) absences without penalty. Any absences in excess of three (3) will result in a half letter grade reduction of the final grade for the course per absence. All absences will be counted. A student who will acquire absences due to a University sponsored activities must meet with me prior to the absences to make any special arrangements for missed work. A student who does not meet with me before the absences are incurred will be counted as absent. Any special medical or personal problems that occur, where absenteeism will exceed the allowed three may require course withdrawal or incomplete status on the final grade. Seven (7) absences mandates an automatic grade of F.

### Academic Integrity
University Policies and Rules Guidelines states that academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University's Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students' dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to acts such as cheating on exams or assignments; plagiarizing the words or ideas of another; fabricating information or citations; facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others; claiming authorship of work done by another person; submitting work completed in previous classes; and/or submitting the same work to multiple classes in which a student is enrolled simultaneously.

### Disability Policy
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The Office for Disability Services (ODS) Web site provides contact information for every Penn State campus: http://equity.psu.edu/ods/dcl. For further information, please visit the Office for Disability Services Web site: http://equity.psu.edu/ods.

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation:http://equity.psu.edu/ods/guidelines. If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus’s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

### Exam Policy
An integral aspect this class is viewing, discussing, and responding to your own work and the work of your peers. The group critique is at all times a comfortable and constructive environment designed for in­depth analysis and evaluation. Through this process, each student will learn how to respond and challenge the formal (aesthetic), conceptual (idea) and interpretative (understanding) characteristics of any given artwork. Most importantly, the critique environment will push you to question and resolve your own artistic production. As with producing work, there are unlimited ways in which art can be approached and considered. If your assignment is not complete for the critique, your grade on that assignment will be lowered by one full letter for each class day it is late. You are required to attend critiques even if your work is not complete.
