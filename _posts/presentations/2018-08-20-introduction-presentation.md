##Welcome
###Warning:

>**We have a ton of material to cover this semester.** To do well in this class, you have to work really hard, so make sure you are prepared to commit to a rigorous work ethic! You will lose sleep this semester, but it will be fun!
</section>
<section data-markdown>
##What is this class about?

1. This is an __**art**__ class
2. We also happen to use indistry standard design tools.

>Theme prompts require that you will take novel and creative approaches to visual and conceptual investigations. Your ability to be a creative problem solver is more important than your ability to model or texture.

</section>
<section data-markdown>
**Question:** Can I make game environments, characters, short films, etc?

**Answer:** Yup!

>The projects in this class support your individual creative interests. How you solve for the project themes are up to you, as long as they are within the constraints of the project, and projects are fairly open ended. Never do something just because you’ll think that I’ll like it. Take ownership of your work.

##Technology sucks! _part 1_
- Rule #1: Never trust technology
  - Plan Ahead by doing the following:
  - Turn on Autosave
  - Always have a backup (the computer lab machine doesn't count)
  - Make sure your backups are synced

</section>
<section data-markdown>
##Technology sucks! _part 2_
  - The computer lab computers get wiped every few days
  - Allow enough time to render your project twice because:
    - You will make mistakes
    - You have a chance to improve work
  - Save multiple scene files at different stages (iteratively) because Maya will:
    - Crash and corrupt your **one and only** file
    - Crash before you had a chance to save
